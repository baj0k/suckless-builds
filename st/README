My build of st, the simple terminal by suckless.org based on Luke's build (https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/st)

# Useful bindings
alt-k/j or alt-PgUp/PgDn to scrollback
alt-shift-PgUp/PgDn to increase/decrease font size, alt-home ro reset to default
alt-c to copy, alt-v to paste
alt-l to follow urls
alt-y to copy urls
alt-o to copy the output of commands from stdout
alt-shift-return to spawn new terminal instance with the same CWD as the currently focused one
